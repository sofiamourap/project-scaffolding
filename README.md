## Creating your repositories step by step

1. On your GitHub page, select the `+` sign in the top right corner, and select `New repository`
2. Choose your project name (ideally in lower case)
3. Make this private (you can change it to public later on)
4. Initialize with a README if you haven’t already created one locally
5. Select `Create Repository`
6. Invite your instructor as a collaborator
7. Clone file as usual and start working!

## Express Scaffolding Step by Step

1. In your project repository on the terminal, run `npx express-generator` to scaffold the Express application
2. Open the folder in VSCode and remove the `/views` folder (we don’t use it)
3. Remove the view engine setup in app.js file (lines 12-14), because we’re not using any backend template renderers
4. Change `res.render('error')`; to `res.send('error')`; (again, we’re not rendering anything from the backend, we’re just sending responses back to the client)
5. Install packages that you may use, such as MySQL, Nodemon, or Dotenv: `npm install mysql nodemon dotenv`
6. In file `package.json`, remove jade from the dependencies list
7. Install dependencies with `npm install` or `yarn`
8. Copy the model folder from your previous projects. This contains the `helper.js` (which contains a nice wrapper around DB connections, so we can use the db() function from within our code), and it also contains the `database.js` file, which is the migration file for our project (you will need to modify this file so it contains YOUR database tables definitions and dummy data)
9. Add a new script into your `<package.json>` file, that we will use to run our migrations: `"migrate": "node model/database.js"`. Eventually, when you want to run migrations, you will need to run `npm run migrate` or `yarn migrate`
10. Modify the start script so it uses nodemon instead of node: `"start": "nodemon ./bin/www"`
11. In the file `./bin/www`, change the default port to `5000` (around line 15)
12. If you need to store private data and passwords (such as your DB pass), create a `<.env>` file in the Express project root.
13. Add a `.gitignore` file to your project. It should contain at least your `node_modules` and your `.env` file: `/node_modules` `.env`
14. Happy coding!

## React Scaffolding Step by Step

1. Create React app with `npx create-react-app my-app`. (Change `my-app` to the name of your app, e.g. `npx create-react-app emefa-mvp`.
2. In VSCode, in `src` folder, delete the `App.test.js`, `serviceWorker.js`, `setupTests.js` and `logo.svg` files.
3. In `index.js`, remove serviceWorker setup (lines 9-12), and the import from line 5.
4. In `App.css` remove the default styling, but keep the file for if you will use some css styling later.
5. In `App.js`, remove the logo import in line 2, and the header content in lines 8 - 21.
6. Change the functional component into class component, so you can add some state later on.
7. If creating a **front-end only** app, simply navigate into your app folder (`cd folder-name`) and `yarn start` to run the app and begin coding
8. If building a **full-stack app**, continue with the steps below

## Full Stack App Step by Step

1. Scaffold Express as above, and React steps 1-6
2. In `package.json` in your React app, add a proxy for the back end in line 34; `"proxy": "http://localhost:5000"`.
3. Back in the terminal, inside your React app, run `rm -rf .git` to avoid the folder being pushed to GitHub as a sub-module of your main repo.
4. In your Express app, create a new folder named `client`, and copy all the contents of your React app into this folder.
5. You have a full stack app! Happy coding!

## Git Collaboration Steps

1. Fork the repo
2. Clone it
3. In your terminal, run `git remote add upstream [url]` (original url)
4. Still in the terminal, run `git checkout -b staging`

**You will only need to do the first 4 steps the first time you clone the repo**

**The following steps are for your daily workflow:**

_Each time you need to work on some new stuff, make sure you pull latest things from upstream: This brings you up to date with the most recent version of the project. Run the following in your terminal_

5. `git pull --rebase staging` **(if there are merge errors, you will need to resolve them manually in VSCode before continuing. Always read the error message :) )**

   _Work on your stuff locally, then:_

6. `git add .`
7. `git commit -m "whatever"`
8. `git push origin staging` (You’re pushing to YOUR repository, not the upstream)
9. Create a new Pull Request(PR) in staging of your repo to original repo’s staging branch
10. Repeat the cycle from 5 - 9 ;)
